PHP-LibLouis v.0.9
===
PHP-LibLouis is a PHP Library that lets you interact with LibLouisXML directly from PHP code.

##About the Library 
The `PHP-LibLouis` is a PHP library with the goal of the library, making interacting with the command line tool `file2brl (LibLouisXML)` an easy experience in PHP. This library allows complete braille translations from `PHP-LibLouis` library calls. The library allows interaction with the `file2brl` program from within PHP without any knowledge of system calls.

##What you need to use PHP-LibLouis
In order to use the `PHP-LibLouis` PHP framework in your applications, you must first meet some requirements: 

###System Requirements
The system that `PHP-LibLouis` is running on **must have** `file2brl (LibLouisXML)` and the LibLouis packages installed. Furthermore, this software has only been tested on L/MAMP-compatible environments.

####Installing file2brl on Linux Systems
Installing `file2brl` onto Linux-based systems with [apt-get](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto)

	sudo apt-get install liblouisutdml-bin

###PHP Requirements
PHP **must** be able to make a system call using the `system()`, `passthru`, and `exec()` functions. `PHP-LibLouis` relies on this link to be able to call the `file2brl` program and pass data back and forth. On some systems (notably shared hosts), this functionality will most likely be disabled. Disabling this functionality will result in the inability to use `PHP-LibLouis` with your setup. Furthermore, `PHP-LibLouis` will run only on PHP v5.0 and higher, and the use of tempfiles must be allowed.

##Interacting with the Library

###Including PHP-LibLouis in your project 
You will first need to download the PHP-LibLouis framework, and then place the 'PHP-Liblouis' folder inside of your PHP project. Then, in order to use the functionality, you will need to include the `php-liblouis.php` file in your PHP project. 

	//include once 
	include_once 'php-liblouis.php';   
	
or 

	//require
	require_once 'php-liblouis.php';
	
**It is important that you DO NOT call any of the `PHP-LibLouis` functions or use any of the variables containing an underscore (_). These functions are for use by the `PHP-LibLouis` system for system functionality only.**

##Library Functions
There are numerous library functions that aid in the ability to translate a plain text string into various braille outputs.

###`function returnBrailleForString($textToTranslate, $libLouisOptions)`
When called, this function will return a Braille ASCII encoded string that can be used by your program at will. The `$textToTranslate` variable should be a plain-text string that you wish to translate into a Braille ASCII string of text. If the translation fails, then the function `returnBrailleForString` will return a constant of either `kErrorTranslating_NoText`, `kErrorHandlingFile`, or `kErrorReceivingFile`. Anything else should be considered a successfully translated string of text.

**Usage**
	
	include('/path/to/PHP-LibLouis.php');
	
	//vars
	$textToBeTranslated = "Hello, World!";
	
	$translatedText = returnBrailleForString($textToBeTranslated, kNoOptions);
	
	if($translatedText == kErrorTranslating_NoText || 
	   $translatedText == kErrorHandlingFile || 
	   $translatedText == kErrorReceivingFile)
	{
		//translation failed
	}
	else
	{
		//do something with $translatedText
	}

###`function returnBRFFileForString($textToTranslate, $libLouisOptions)`

When called, this function will return a PHP tempfile with the Braille ASCII contents included that can be used in your program at will. The `$textToTranslate` variable should be a plain-text string that you wish to translate into a braille-ready file. Remember that the tempfile that is returned will not be `unlinked` by `PHP-LibLouis`. It is up to you to call `unlink($file)` to remove the temp file.

**Usage**

	include('/path/to/PHP-LibLouis.php');
	
	//vars 
	$textToBeTranslated = "Hello, World!";
	
	$translatedText = returnBRFFileForString($textToBeTranslated, kNoOptions);
	
	if($translatedText == kErrorTranslating_NoText || 
	   $translatedText == kErrorHandlingFile || 
	   $translatedText == kErrorReceivingFile)
	{
		//translation failed
	}
	else
	{
		//do something with $translatedText file
	}
	
	unlink($translatedText);
	
	
### Constants
There are many helpful constants that make `PHP-LibLouis` easier to check for errors and all-around easier to use. Below are all of the constants that `PHP-LibLouis` uses. 

####Option Constants 
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Option Constant Name</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>kNoOptions</td>
		<td>Uses the standard file2brl translation options.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

####Error Constants
The error constants make it easier to detect and check for errors in your program's logic. Here are the error constants that PHP-LibLouis uses. 

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Error Constant Name</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>kErrorTranslating_NoText</td>
		<td>Means that there was no text provided to the translation function. Ensure that text was provided in the correct argument order.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>kErrorTranslating_NotConfigured</td>
		<td>LibLouis and/or file2brl is not installed on the system. Follow our guide above to install file2brl onto your system before attempting to use the PHP-LibLouis framework.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>kErrorHandlingFile</td>
		<td>There was an error creating, reading, or writing to the PHP temp files. Ensure that PHP temp files, and specifically the tempnam() PHP function, is allowed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>kErrorReceivingFile</td>
		<td>No text was provided back in the translation file from the file2brl CLI program. Ensure that file2brl is installed and working properly.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Temp Files
`PHP-LibLouis` utilizes PHP tempfiles to interact with the `file2brl` CLI program. As a result, two temp files will be stored on your system at `/tmp` for every system call made to `PHP-LibLouis`. If an error is encountered, or if you are using the `returnBrailleForString()` function, then all of the temp files at this location will be cleaned up automatically by initiating a call to the `unlink()` PHP function. **However, the translated text file that is returned by `returnBRFFileForString()` will not be cleaned up automatically through the `unlink()` PHP function -- it is up to your program to clean up the remaining temp file resulting from the use of the `returnBRFFileForString()` .**

### Options
For version 0.9 of the PHP-LibLouis framework, options are not yet included; however, as the documentation states, any options will be passed to the functions as a string for either `returnBrailleForString()` or `returnBRFFileForString()`.
